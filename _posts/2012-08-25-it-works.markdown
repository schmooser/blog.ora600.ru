It works!

This is my new blog, powered by static site generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

Theme is forked from [Danovan Hutchinson](http://hop.ie). It has light [solarized](ethanschoonover.com/solarized)-like colors and supports highlighting for many languages.

I will post here stuff about my work, about some computer research and will write about my life events. This blog will be in English to practise my writing skills.

SQL-highlighting test:
{% highlight sql %}
select * from dba_objects;
{% endhighlight %}
