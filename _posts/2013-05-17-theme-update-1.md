I slightly updated theme of this blog. Now, if post have `description` variable in YAML front-matter section, then it's shown on index pages instead of full post content. Useful in long posts with many code and images.

From now I stated that blog's theme is on v1.0. I will develop theme and will increase version accordingly. If you like theme â€“ [fork it on Github](https://github.com/schmooser/schmooser.github.io), delete `_posts` and `_drafts` folders and read [Jekyll's documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/).
