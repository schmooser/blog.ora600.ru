I work in largest non-state bank in Russia. We have a "great bank firewall", as we call it, at work. It doesn't let us to go on the most sites on the Internet. It doesn't let us to download files from Internet. 

Recently an IT department replaced Internet Explorer with Chrome as default Internet browser on our machines. But we are not allowed to install browser extensions, because firewall blocks downloading of any file from the Internet.

But I need some extensions to browse the web comfortably â€“ there are vimium and google translate. So, I decided to download them at home and bring them to work on flash-drive. I found an [answer](http://superuser.com/questions/290280/how-to-download-chrome-extensions-for-installing-in-another-computer) on superuser.com which describes how to download them manually. Now I've downloaded them in form of crx files and I will try to install them on my work's machine tomorrow.

UPD: Everything went fine. Just drag'n'drop extension file on the Chrome window on Extensions page and extension will be installed.
