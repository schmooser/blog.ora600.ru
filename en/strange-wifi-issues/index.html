    <p>Yesterday, there were my girlfriend’s guests in our home. They stayed for a night. 
I am not a friend of them, so I decided to go to bedroom and lay on with reading web with iPad. 
But when I tried to browse the web, I had found than Internet is not working. 
WiFi connection is alive, iPad has an IP and router’s address but I can’t browse the web. 
If I switch WiFi off and on Internet appears but for a dozen of seconds. Then it vanishes again. 
I tried to find some kind of ping utility for iPad. With a number of retries I downloaded a 
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/free-ping/id430758871">FreePing</a> and tried to ping my router on 192.168.1.1. All packets was lost. But, of cource, 
the WiFi was on and the signal has 2 of 3 bars. </p>

<p>That was so strange, because my girlfriend’s iPhone worked well.</p>

<p>I tried to find out on the Internet if another people experienced such problems. There are 
a dozens of such problems, discussed on apple.com and there is a 
<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1398">guide of troubleshooting this</a>. I did all of that but 
nothing does work. I was gone to sleep. </p>

<p>Today my problems continued. Then guests gone. And everything became fine. 
iPad works as before. Fantastic.</p>

<p>But, after iPad gone to sleep and I woke it up the Internet was missed again. 
After turning WiFi off and on it became working.</p>

<p>Finally, I hopely fixed the problems by turning off DHCP on router and by writing static 
IP’s on all of my network devices. The article on iPad WiFi problems is <a href="http://appletoolbox.com/2010/04/ipad-wi-fi-problems-comprehensive-list-of-fixes/">this</a>. 
The first comment is very helpful.</p>
