<h2 id="the-complex-russian-language">The complex Russian language</h2>

<p>There is a table behind us. There are glass and a fork on it. What are they doing? The glass is standing, but the fork is laying. If we stick the fork in the tabletop then the fork will be standing. So, vertical stuff stands and horizontal lie. </p>

<p>Now let’s add a plate and a pan on the table. They are seemed to be a horizontal, but they are standing on the table. Now we put the plate into the pan. Voila, the plate is laying in the pan nevertheless it was standing on the table.</p>

<p>May be the stuff that is ready to using is standing? No, the fork was ready to use whet it was laying on the table. </p>

<p>Now a cat is climbing on the table. It can sit on the table as well as lay and stand on it. We can explain “lay” and “stand” with “vertical-horizontal” logic, but sitting is the new one property. It’s sitting on the butt. Now a bird sits on a table. It sits on a table, but it sits on its legs not on butt. But it should be staying! If we remove the bird and make a staffed bird from it, it  will magically stands on the table!</p>

<p>It seems that sitting is the being’s property, but a boot is sitting on the leg as it’s not a being and it have no butt. So, let’s understand what is sitting, what is laying and what is standing.</p>

<p>And we russians are wondering why foreigners think that Russian is complicated and compare it to Chinese.</p>

    <p>Yesterday, there were my girlfriend’s guests in our home. They stayed for a night. 
I am not a friend of them, so I decided to go to bedroom and lay on with reading web with iPad. 
But when I tried to browse the web, I had found than Internet is not working. 
WiFi connection is alive, iPad has an IP and router’s address but I can’t browse the web. 
If I switch WiFi off and on Internet appears but for a dozen of seconds. Then it vanishes again. 
I tried to find some kind of ping utility for iPad. With a number of retries I downloaded a 
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/free-ping/id430758871">FreePing</a> and tried to ping my router on 192.168.1.1. All packets was lost. But, of cource, 
the WiFi was on and the signal has 2 of 3 bars. </p>

<p>That was so strange, because my girlfriend’s iPhone worked well.</p>

<p>I tried to find out on the Internet if another people experienced such problems. There are 
a dozens of such problems, discussed on apple.com and there is a 
<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1398">guide of troubleshooting this</a>. I did all of that but 
nothing does work. I was gone to sleep. </p>

<p>Today my problems continued. Then guests gone. And everything became fine. 
iPad works as before. Fantastic.</p>

<p>But, after iPad gone to sleep and I woke it up the Internet was missed again. 
After turning WiFi off and on it became working.</p>

<p>Finally, I hopely fixed the problems by turning off DHCP on router and by writing static 
IP’s on all of my network devices. The article on iPad WiFi problems is <a href="http://appletoolbox.com/2010/04/ipad-wi-fi-problems-comprehensive-list-of-fixes/">this</a>. 
The first comment is very helpful.</p>

    <p>I wrote some notes in russian to my main blog – <a href="iseetheline.ru">iseetheline.ru</a>. It’s powered by blog engine named <a href="http://blogengine.ru">Aegea</a>. It has beautiful minimalistic design which I like, it installs simply, it has many features like drag-and-drop image uploading, saving to drafts, tagging, built-in comments, search, rss, support of plugins and so on. But it lacks in three things. </p>

<ol>
  <li>Posts should be written using wiki-formatting via web-interface. I HATE wiki-formatting. I love markdown. I love vim. I can’t even remember the rules of wiki-formatting to write links, images and so on.</li>
  <li>It’s written on php and is not open-source. That’s why I can’t modify it to my needs.</li>
  <li>It doesn’t have syntax highlighting by default.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, it’s great to write about the stuff that happened in daily life, but it’s not suitable for tech notes with many syntax-highlited code.</p>

<p>Finally I decided to switch to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is not the engine – it’s a static site generator. You write posts, Jekyll generate a static content from them, you put it on hosting. That’s all. That’s the way I like the things should happen. </p>

<p>I’ve started to look at Jekyll about a month ago. The things that stop me from starting new Jekyll-based blog was the lack of easy-to-use themes (I don’t understand how <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com">Jekyll bootstrap</a> works so I don’t tried it). Today I’ve decided to try again. For that I’ve used some thins which are new for me: git, github, jekyll, sass.</p>

<p>The process is a kind of straightforward:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Search suitable open-source theme on the <a href="http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/sites">page with existing sites</a> using Jekyll</li>
  <li>Fork it on <a href="http://github.com">Github</a></li>
  <li>Rename repo to <code>&lt;yourname&gt;.github.com</code></li>
  <li>Clone a repo to a local machine using <code>git clone https://github.com/&lt;yourname&gt;/&lt;yourname&gt;.github.com.git</code></li>
  <li>Delete all posts from <code>_posts</code> directory, edit theme to your needs, edit CNAME file to point the correct domain, edit Jekyll’s <code>_config.yml</code></li>
  <li>Write new post with <code>rake post title="&lt;new title&gt;"</code></li>
  <li>Commit it with <code>git commit -a</code></li>
  <li>Push it to the github with <code>git push origin master</code></li>
  <li>Point the domain name of the blog (CNAME in step 5) to <code>&lt;yourname&gt;.github.com</code></li>
</ol>

<p>To simplify my life and to transform my OS X 10.8.1 (the update was released today) to ultimate blogging machine, I made some tweaks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Added an alias in <code>.bash_profile</code> to search in <a href="http://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> with links:</p>

    <pre><code>ddg()
{
 links duckduckgo.com/?q="$1"
}
alias ddg=ddg
</code></pre>

    <p>If I need a link while writing a post I made <code>ddg "my query"</code> and grab link from there</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Installed a gem <code>cheat</code> to display information about various comands right in the terminal:</p>

    <pre><code>sudo gem install cheat
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>
