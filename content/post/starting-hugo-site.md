Hey there, I decided to start new site using [Hugo] for site generation. It
seems like more flexible and way more quicker then [Jekyll].

So let's have fun and design some theme first.

I desided to base my theme on famous [motherfuckingwebsite.com], actually on
it's [better][bmf] version.

There is a comprehensive [documentation] about how to use Hugo, I get through it,
it's just awesome.


[Hugo]: http://gohugo.io
[Jekyll]: http://jekyllrb.org
[motherfuckingwebsite.com]: http://motherfuckingwebsite.com
[bmf]: http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com
